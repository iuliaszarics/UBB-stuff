1. Create an animation where a ball rolls along a curved path, like a rollercoaster, from one side of the screen to the other. The ball should follow a smooth, continuous arc, and rotate as if it's actually rolling. Use @keyframes for the path animation and transform for the rotation effect.

2. Write a web page which contains a div with a blue background color located on the top left corner of the page. When the mouse is over it the div should move to the bottom right corner of the page. The div should not jump directly to the bottom right corner. During this transition, the background color of the div should transition from blue to full red.
