# UBB-stuff

This repository contains all my computer science homework and assignments from my studies at UBB University, Cluj-Napoca.
It is incomplete as I've lost most files from my laptop in the middle of the second semester from the first year :( .
Here are the subject that I've studied so far:

Year 1:
First semester: Computer Systems Architecture, Fundamentals of Programming, Algebra, Computational Logic, Analysis
Second semester: Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Geometry, Dynamical Systems, Graphs Algorithms
